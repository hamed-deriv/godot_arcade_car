# Arcade Car

Hello everyone, this is my very first plugin althoug I should start with something more simple. Still it is an VehicleBody and VehicleWheel extensions (with two new resources too) that aims to provide a very easy and fast way to setup cars and their respectives gearboxes on Godot. It includes features like ackermann's angle, a 'fake' engine rotation scale and some other tools to properly set the car acceleration according to it's gears speed and ratio. However, the car is still powered by force push and should not be used in realistic car simulations (torque on wheels, etc).
